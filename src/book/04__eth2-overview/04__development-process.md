Though a large portion of its structure has already been specified, Eth2 is very much still a work in progress. From elements of the platform's application layer to initial implementations of the protocol as a whole, Eth2 leaves plenty of room for contributions by community participants. We've dedicated an entire chapter of this book to cataloging the various components of Eth2 that could benefit from additional attention. We further spend some time detailing the structure and processes behind the Eth2 community. This section acts as a brief summary of those ecosystem properties and of the history of more concrete development work.

Early work on Eth2 began, in some ways, even before the launch of Eth1. Time and resource constraints limited most of these efforts to a more theoretical domain. Groups within the Ethereum Foundation laid the foundations for Eth1's Proof-of-Stake protocol as early as 2014. Many of these initial inroads served less as serious contenders to Eth1 and more as kindling to light the fire in the collective imaginations of the Ethereum community. With mind share primarily allocated to Eth1, Eth2 remained a long-term vision.

The Eth2 landscape shifted drastically during 2018. Increased demand on the Eth1 platform once again highlighted the need for improvements in the name of long-term sustainability. Between 2018 and 2019 Eth2 went from a theoretical future to a highly-specified reality. Contributors from countless corners of the Ethereum ecosystem helped to develop a series of concrete design documents that detailed Eth2's proposed operation. By the end of 2019, these documents culminated in the first interactions among seven unique Eth2 client software packages. Though it may have once seemed a farfetched concept, Eth2 is now very much a reality.

Rapid development of Eth2 in the recent past highlights the power of Ethereum's open community structure. Quickly after its launch, Eth1 managed to attract a diverse base of individuals willing to contribute back to the ecosystem. To this day, most Ethereum-related research is carried out in public. Platforms like Ethresearch act as forums in which anyone may read, publish, or give feed back on new ideas. Eth2 development efforts are chronicled in various conference calls held on regular intervals. Almost all Ethereum-related software projects are hosted on platforms like GitHub that actively encourage participation from new contributors.

We give significantly more detailed overviews of the various Eth2 projects and collaboration platforms in our later chapter exploring the Eth2 ecosystem. However, we've included several sidebars within the following chapters that point readers to relevant projects. Readers are encouraged to look into these sidebars if their contents seem interesting. Ethereum truly makes research and development accessible to an extent unmatched in most project ecosystems. It's likely that any Eth2 project one encounters will be more than happy to receive additional assistance.
